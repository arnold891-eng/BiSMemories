  BiSMemories :: Core/Slash.lua - /memories.

      /memories                 the last ten, newest first
      /memories all             everything kept
      /memories now [note]      take one right now, with an optional note
      /memories on|off <thing>  levelup, boss, loot, achievement, death, duel
      /memories loot <2-5>      the quality worth a picture: 4 is epic, 3 is rare.
                                YOUR loot only - plus anyone's legendary, whoever won it
      /memories gap <seconds>   the least time between two shots
      /memories sound           the click on or off
      /memories clear           forget the notes (never touches the pictures)
      /memories status          what is on, and where the pictures live
      /memories journal         the album in game: what happened, newest first. No pictures -
                                an addon cannot list a folder, and cannot draw a .jpg. See
                                Core/Journal.lua for why that is not a Forever thing.

  Reading it back matters as much as taking it: the note names the file the client wrote, so a
  picture in Screenshots\ can be matched to the night it came from.

--- WHAT THE CAMERA HAS HEARD THIS SESSION, and what it did about it.

--- An album with one picture has two explanations - nothing worth remembering happened, or the
--- event never arrived - and they look identical from outside. This tells them apart: counts for
--- what has come in, the verdict on the last few, and the list of events that have not arrived at
--- all. A name on that last list is either an event this client does not send or a thing that has
--- not happened yet, and only the person at the keyboard knows which.
